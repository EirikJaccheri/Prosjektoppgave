abstract = {This text presents the mathematical concepts of Grassmann variables and the method of supersymmetry to a broad audience of physicists interested in applying these tools to disordered and critical systems, as well as related topics in statistical physics. Based on many courses and seminars held by the author, one of the pioneers in this field, the reader is given a systematic and tutorial introduction to the subject matter. The algebra and analysis of Grassmann variables is presented in part I. The mathematics of these variables is applied to a random matrix model, path integrals for fermions, dimer models and the Ising model in two dimensions. Supermathematics - the use of commuting and anticommuting variables on an equal footing - is the subject of part II. The properties of supervectors and supermatrices, which contain both commuting and Grassmann components, are treated in great detail, including the derivation of integral theorems. In part III, supersymmetric physical models are considered. While supersymmetry was first introduced in elementary particle physics as exact symmetry between bosons and fermions, the formal introduction of anticommuting spacetime components, can be extended to problems of statistical physics, and, since it connects states with equal energies, has also found its way into quantum mechanics. Several models are considered in the applications, after which the representation of the random matrix model by the nonlinear sigma-model, the determination of the density of states and the level correlation are derived. Eventually, the mobility edge behavior is discussed and a short account of the ten symmetry classes of disorder, two-dimensional disordered models, and superbosonization is given.

@article{Hugdal2019,
abstract = {We study the inverse proximity effect in a bilayer consisting of a thin s- or d-wave superconductor (S) and a topological insulator (TI). Integrating out the topological fermions of the TI, we find that spin-orbit coupling is induced in the S, which leads to spin-triplet p-wave (f-wave) correlations in the anomalous Green's function for an s-wave (d-wave) superconductor. Solving the self-consistency equation for the superconducting order parameter, we find that the inverse proximity effect can be strong for parameters for which the Fermi momenta of the S and TI coincide. The suppression of the gap is approximately proportional to e-1/$\lambda$, where $\lambda$ is the dimensionless superconducting coupling constant. This is consistent with the fact that a higher $\lambda$ gives a more robust superconducting state. For an s-wave S, the interval of TI chemical potentials for which the suppression of the gap is strong is centered at $\mu$TI=Â±2mvF2$\mu$A2, and increases quadratically with the hopping parameter t. Since the S chemical potential $\mu$ typically is high for conventional superconductors, the inverse proximity effect is negligible except for t above a critical value. For sufficiently low t, however, the inverse proximity effect is negligible, in agreement with what has thus far been assumed in most works studying the proximity effect in S-TI structures. In superconductors with low Fermi energies, such as high-Tc cuprates with d-wave symmetry, we again find a suppression of the order parameter. However, since $\mu$ is much smaller in this case, a strong inverse proximity effect can occur at $\mu$TI=0 for much lower values of t. Moreover, the onset of a strong inverse proximity effect is preceded by an increase in the order parameter, allowing the gap to be tuned by several orders of magnitude by small variations in $\mu$TI.},
